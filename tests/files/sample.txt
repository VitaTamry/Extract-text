Dear Hiring Team,


I am excited to express my interest in the Senior PHP Developer position at Intergo Telecom. With over 7 years of hands-on experience in PHP and Laravel, 
Working closely with stakeholders and cross-functional teams, I translated business needs into reliable products. From writing user stories and implementing solutions to testing, deployment, and documentation, I ensured alignment with long-term plans and scalability.


I have successfully delivered innovative solutions across diverse industries, from publishing and food delivery to media archive, wallet, and recruitment.




During my tenure at Al-Mal News, I encountered a critical challenge in optimizing the performance and reliability of our digital platform to enhance user experience. One notable architectural and technical choice I made was to address the issue of slow page load times and service downtime. By leveraging my expertise and strategic thinking, I implemented a series of innovative solutions aimed at improving performance and scalability. One significant decision was to integrate ElasticSearch for efficient data retrieval, which allowed for quicker access to content and improved search functionality. Additionally, I decoupled the frontend using NextJs to optimize content delivery, enabling faster loading time for users accessing our website. Furthermore, I migrated our backend server architecture from a single large server to a scalable autoscaling group of smaller servers, ensuring high availability and scalability to handle unexpected traffic spikes effectively. These architectural choices resulted in a remarkable improvement, reducing the page load time from 6 seconds to just 1.5 seconds and increasing service uptime from 96% to 99.6%. Ultimately, these enhancements significantly benefited our users by providing them with faster and more reliable access to news and information, thereby enhancing their overall experience on our platform.


During my involvement with the Egypt OpenDatabase project, tasked with digitizing the state's general budget financial statements into an easily accessible online database, I undertook the challenge of reverse-engineering the financial data, designing databases to accommodate its complexity, and implementing both the backend logic and the user interface (SPA). This endeavor began with a meticulous analysis of the financial statements to understand their structure and content thoroughly. Leveraging my expertise in backend development, I crafted a robust database schema capable of efficiently storing and managing the data while ensuring its accuracy and integrity. Concurrently, I focused on developing a frontend SPA that offered users a seamless and intuitive interface to navigate through the financial data. Throughout the development process, I collaborated closely with the project team to address technical challenges and ensure the final product met its objectives. The result of these architectural and technical choices was a user-friendly online database that empowered stakeholders to access and analyze critical financial information, ultimately facilitating informed decision-making based on insights gleaned from the database. This experience underscored the importance of thoughtful architectural decisions and technical implementations in delivering impactful solutions that meet user needs.
 


My technical expertise extends to frameworks such as Laravel, WordPress, and NextJs, coupled with hands-on experience with technologies like ElasticSearch, caching strategies, SEO, and Cloud services (AWS). Also, I'm an AI enthusiast and love to try and explore the capabilities of AI models and how to benefit from them in my work.


Thank you for considering my application.
